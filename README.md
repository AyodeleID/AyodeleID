# Ayodele ID – Economist & Data Scientist

Hello there - I am Ayodele. I apply econometrics and data science to answer questions about markets, policy and everyday behaviour. My projects range from forecasting modelling to analysing global trends, big data analytics, and retail promotions and customer analytics. On this page you will find a snapshot of who I am and some selected projects I have been working on.

## What I Do

* **Econometrics & causal inference** – modelling relationships in economic data and measuring the effects of policies or interventions.
* **Time‑series & forecasting** – predicting trends in financial markets, public health and sports.
* **Machine learning & natural language processing** – turning unstructured text into structured insights.
* **Data storytelling** – building dashboards and visualisations that make complex information easy to understand.

## Featured Projects

Here are a few highlights from my public repositories. Each project links to the full code and write‑up.

* **COVID‑19 global analytics** – analysis and visualisation of the spread and economic impact of COVID‑19 across countries, using Python and Plotly.
* **Financial econometrics codes** – examples of ARMA, GARCH, VAR and other models for returns and volatility in both Python and R.
* **Rumor detection** – an NLP pipeline for classifying news items as rumours or verified information.
* **Sales promotion analysis** – an Excel dashboard exploring sales performance during and outside promotional periods.
* **EPL forecast 2025–26** – time‑series models forecasting English Premier League standings.
